v 1.2{
    I added some styles and overall design for the project. Also adding and removing points in game, added ranking.
    Plans for v 1.3:
    I. Adjust lists and elements sizes to different screen resolutions
    II. Add styles to li element in add players page
    III. Add animation to red element in alert to show how much time is left to disapear
    IV. Block minus points for players
    V. Sort from higher to lower points amount in ranking page
    VI. Input -> add enter works on add button, remove text from input when added
    VII. Add some animations when round is over(confetti?)
